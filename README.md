# Enterprise Plans for Habitat

![Habitat Logo](img/habitat.png)

[habitat](https://habitat.sh) is solves the problem of how we build,
configure, deploy and manage applications; it puts the entire Devops
lifecycle into the hands of service developers.

This repository provides the sources for building Enterprise-ready
(scalable and health-checked) Habitat plans for:

- Cratedb
- Drupal
- etcd
- Jenkins
- jtty
- Postfix

Plans in this repository are all available in the `Endocode` origin in
app.habitat.sh and can be added to your Habitat studio with: `hab
install endocode/<plan name>`.
