# Enterprise Plans for Habitat

![Habitat Logo](img/habitat.png)

[habitat](https://habitat.sh) solves the problem of how we build,
configure, deploy and manage applications; it puts the entire Devops
lifecycle into the hands of service developers.

This repository provides the sources for building Enterprise-ready
(scalable and health-checked) Habitat plans for:

- Cratedb
- Drupal
- etcd
- Jenkins
- jtty
- Postfix

Plans in this repository are all available in the `Endocode` origin in
app.habitat.sh and can be added to your Habitat studio with: `hab
install endocode/<plan name>`. Each plan has its own folder within
this repository including its own documentation.

## Contributions

Please feel free to clone this repository and submit pull requests in
order to make improvements to these plans. For any further questions,
please email the Endocode Habitat Team
[<habitat@endocode.com>](mailto:habitat@endocode.com). Support for
Habitat is avialable on the [Habitat community Slack
channel](http://slack.habitat.sh).

This repository has a project for tracking improvements to each plan;
each plan has its own Kanban board. These boards are used for tracking
who is working on which improvements. If you have a *bug* to submit,
please use the Github issue tracker for this repository. Bugs will
eventualy be mapped to task on a plan's Janban board.
